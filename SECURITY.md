# Security

Thanks for helping make TMCB safe for everyone.

TMCB takes the security of our software seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through [this GitHub organization](https://github.com/TMCB-SPACE).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**If you think you've found a security issue, please DO NOT report, discuss, or describe it on Discord or GitHub.**

Please create resources necessary to reproduce the problem when sending over information, including an example repository on StackBlitz or GitHub. Please don't add explicit details about the security issue you are reporting in any of the repository's contents.

Optionally, if the issue is critical, create a personal private repository and share access with our code owners:
